Advanced staff monitoring and player protection system for Minecraft servers.

---

## 📖 Overview

CoreProtectionAssistant (CPA) is a **zero-trust** staff monitoring and player reputation system. It tracks staff actions, analyzes player behavior, and provides detailed statistics without creating new menus — all data is accessible via PlaceholderAPI for use in other plugins (CMI, DeluxeMenus, ItemsAdder, etc.).

**Key principle:** The plugin doesn't store data that already exists elsewhere — it reads from CoreProtect, CMI, and LuckPerms.

## ✨ Features

### Staff Monitoring
- Track all staff commands (`/give`, `/gamemode`, `/ban`, `/mute`, `/kick`, `/invsee`, etc.)
- **Abuse Score System** — calculates a 0-100 score based on suspicious actions
- Automatic warnings when abuse score exceeds thresholds
- Detailed staff statistics with full action history

### Player Protection
- **Unified Chat Rules** — single configuration for both punishments and apologies
- Regex-based detection with priorities and recidivism tracking
- Automatic warning clearance for apologies
- **Apologies Tracking** — counts apologies and calculates repentance ratio (apologies / violations)
- **Report System** with anti-abuse protection
- Automatic violator analysis based on playtime, warnings, and report count
- **Same IP & Alt Detection** — detects players with same IP and similar nicknames
- **Prohibited Permissions Check** — alerts when staff members have dangerous permissions

### 🛡️ Grief Detection (NEW)
- **Direct CoreProtect database reading** — no duplicate storage
- **Block history analysis** — checks if other players interacted with the same block
- **Similar nickname detection** — `1=i=l`, `0=o`, `5=s=6`, etc.
- **Configurable tracked blocks** — chests, furnaces, shulkers, hoppers, etc.
- **Separate punishments for players and staff**

### 🤖 ChatBot (NEW)
- Fully configurable chatbot that responds to player messages
- **Rule-based system** with priorities, permissions, and cooldowns
- **Condition support** — use PAPI placeholders with comparisons (`>`, `<`, `==`, `contains`, `AND`, `OR`)
- **Symbol prefix** — respond only to messages starting with `!`, `?`, etc.
- **Random responses** — choose from a list of possible answers
- **Delayed responses** — bot can wait before replying
- **Chance-based triggers** — probability of response in percentage
- **Context variables** — `%player_name%`, `%player_world%`, `%player_time%`, `%target%`, `%message%`
- All command prefixes supported: `message!`, `broadcast!`, `asConsole!`, `sound!`, `title!`, `actionbar!`

### ⏱️ Temporary Warnings & Silent Mode (NEW)
- **Temporary warnings** — `-t:1d` (day), `-t:1h` (hour), `-t:1m` (minute), `-t:1s` (second)
- **Silent mode** — `-s` flag suppresses all command output
- Example: `/cpa warn Player Griefing -t:20m -s`

### Statistics & Integration
- CoreProtect integration (via reflection and direct DB — no hard dependency)
- PlaceholderAPI support (35+ placeholders)
- SQLite (with HikariCP connection pool) and MySQL support
- Optional integrations: CMI, LuckPerms

### Quality of Life
- **Full localization** — all messages in `lang.yml` (supports HEX colors `&#RRGGBB`)
- **Message toggling** — disable any message by setting it to `""` or `"none"`
- **Offline player tab-complete** — all commands suggest offline players (up to 20)
- **Centralized reload** — `/cpa reload` reloads all configurations including ChatBot
- **Debug mode** — `debug: true/false` in config for troubleshooting

❓ FAQ

  Q: Why "zero-trust"?
  A: The plugin assumes staff members might abuse their powers. It tracks everything and calculates an abuse score to alert owners.

  Q: Does it work without CoreProtect?
  A: Yes, but block/chest/command statistics and grief detection will be unavailable.

  Q: Can I customize the abuse score weights?
  A: Yes, in config.yml under abuse_weights.

  Q: How do I add new chat rules?
  A: Edit chattrules.yml and use /cpa reload.

  Q: What is "recidivism"?
  A: Repeated violations within a time window result in harsher punishments.

  Q: How do I disable a specific message?
  A: Set it to "" or "none" in lang.yml.

```bash
